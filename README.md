MPT is a tool for creating packages of files contains multimedia data.
I created this to be useful for the internet assets.

Idea is to guess as much of sprite data as it is possible based on the files itself. 
You can provide your own JSON with definitions. JSON file is used to provide meta, like origin of the position, sound files, or animation parameters.
